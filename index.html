<p> <b> <u> Abstract </u></b><br> 
Procrastination is one of the most misunderstood behaviours in modern society, it is not a time management problem that so many people believe it to be. It turns out it is mostly if not completely emotional. We should be treating procrastinators the same way as people with severe mental health issues and the stigma around them is not only harmful it is only fuelling the vicious cycle. It also turns out people don’t procrastinate because they ‘work better under pressure’ as over stress does not seem to benefit any task and often hinders performance. We should tackle the problems with understanding for others and oneself focusing on progressive thinking. Procrastination seems to be used as a self defence mechanism and those who may be insecure about their ability or perfectionists who struggle to deal with people critiquing their work. Positive reinforcement seems to work well breaking up a task into smaller units and then rewarding when finished.
