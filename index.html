    <p id="Abs"> <b> <u> Abstract </u></b><br> 
Procrastination is one of the most misunderstood behaviours in modern society, it is not a time management problem that so many people believe it to be. It turns out it is mostly if not completely emotional. We should be treating procrastinators the same way as people with severe mental health issues and the stigma around them is not only harmful it is only fuelling the vicious cycle. It also turns out people don’t procrastinate because they ‘work better under pressure’ as over stress does not seem to benefit any task and often hinders performance. We should tackle the problems with understanding for others and oneself focusing on progressive thinking. Procrastination seems to be used as a self defence mechanism and those who may be insecure about their ability or perfectionists who struggle to deal with people critiquing their work. Positive reinforcement seems to work well breaking up a task into smaller units and then rewarding when finished.

    <p id="What">What is procrastinating? The <a href="#Ref">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines it “To defer action, delay; to be dilatory.” This makes procrastination seem innocent, perhaps it is just that. So you procrastinate... but are you a procrastinator? Well Ferrari says “What I’ve found is that while everybody may procrastinate, not everyone is a procrastinator.” <a href="#Ref">(Association for Psychological Science, 2023)</a>

</p>
    <p id="Lock">What makes a procrastinator? We probably think of a lazy person with poor time management and low ambition, but we’re mistaken “It really has nothing to do with time-management,” <a href="#Ref">(Association for Psychological Science, 2023).</a> So what kind of behaviours make these people procrastinators “If I have a dozen things to do, obviously #10, #11, and #12 have to wait,” <a href="#Ref">(Association for Psychological Science, 2023)</a>. “The real procrastinator has those 12 things, maybe does one or two of them, then rewrites the list, then shuffles it around, then makes an extra copy of it. That’s procrastinating. That’s different.” <a href="#Ref">(Association for Psychological Science, 2023)</a> For me the main point of a being a procrastinator is they will consistently put things off no matter how many problems it may cause or how stressed they will be doing it last moment. Okay you might be thinking why these people don’t stop putting things off? Ferrari says “As I tell people, to tell the chronic procrastinator to just do it would be like saying to a clinically depressed person, cheer up.”<a href="#Ref">(Association for Psychological Science, 2023).</a> This may come to a surprise to some that this issue isn’t as simple as it sounds. The causes of these behaviours can be linked to depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, ADHD, poor study habits and lack of structure. Before we look at ways to stop procrastination lets go deeper into the misunderstandings. </p>
    <p id="Miss">Procrastination is grossly misunderstood topics in my opinion, In year 12 my school invited a previous student back to talk to us about general sixth form stuff I remember mustering up the courage to ask him how he dealt with procrastination, he had no answer he almost seem confused by the question, one of the teachers present chuckled and said something like ‘just start’. It turns out it’s not that simple and people who procrastinate are not simply lazy. It seems to be more of an emotional regulation problem than anything. I believe this view point on procrastinators is rather damaging these people already struggle emotionally and by simply passing them off as lazy and not addressing the real problem. People procrastinate because ‘they work better under pressure’ <a href="#Ref">(Deprocrastination, 2024)</a>. This is objectively false <a href="#Ref">(Sirois, Yang and van Dijk, 2021)</a> tell us that ‘over‐aroused children respond indiscriminately, to both the sought‐for object and distractors.’ This means that when it comes to be overly anxious which induces an element of stress to the task children had harder times ignoring all the noise which is highlighted in their <a href="#Ref">(figure 1)</a> This makes more sense when we think about what exactly is happening in the body and mind. The shortness of breath, wobbly knees, increased heart rate all symptoms of anxiety and stress, but these symptoms are the same as the body’s flight or fight response turns out it IS the response. As we know when in these situations our brain will often try to take in as much information as possible it seems this is exactly what is happening here to ‘survive’ the body isn’t allowing for focus or not the one needed for this task. I think this makes it obvious that we don’t work better overly stressed</p>
    <p id="Care">
      Why should we care about procrastination? Well say you’re a business owner turns out procrastination may take up one quarter of each workday <a href="#Ref">(World Economic Forum, 2022)</a>. Alright maybe you’re not a business owner but you have someone that you care about. As discussed, procrastination is a mood regulation issue  ‘Procrastination also correlates with a serious health and wellbeing problems, a tendency to procrastinate is linked to poor mental health, including higher levels of depression and anxiety’ <a href="#Ref">(World Economic Forum, 2023)</a>. Turns out that person you’re calling lazy may be suffering with severe mental health conditions and you should be looking to help. Finally let’s explore the perspective of a chronic procrastinator turns out ‘for every one-point increase on a measure of chronic procrastination salary decreased by US$15,000 (£12,450)’ (August 2022). Money is known to many adults as a stressor only repeating the cycle and promoting further procrastinating worsening the person’s mental health.

    <p id="Stop">How do we stop procrastination? In hindsight I should’ve written & researched this part first anyhow. First tip is evaluating how we talk to ourselves about our procrastination the McGraw-Princeton University resource <a href="#Ref">(McGraw, n.d.)</a> as well as the <a href="#Ref">World economic forum (2022)</a> seem to agree on this. Earlier we spoke about how telling a procrastinator to just start is like telling a depressed person to just cheer up. Instead of using pessimistic language that focuses on regret we should try and use some that focuses on progression and forgiveness. <a href="#Ref">The World Economic Forum (2022)</a> goes says that procrastination can be used as a kind of shield for one’s self image people will put off what is difficult in order to look at themselves as stupid it the goes on to highlight this is an element of perfectionism we can’t stand the feeling of being inadequate which links back to the low self-esteem. This makes more sense when you realise it gives you the excuse of ‘” not having enough” time’ <a href="#Ref">(McGraw, n.d.)</a> that’s a lot easier to say than I wasn’t good enough. Therefore, it is logical to assume that a detachment from these unrealistic expectations can help with procrastination. McGraw then goes on to write about how slicing the workload into small tasks and offering rewards for completing them.
